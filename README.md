# FindAcrossAllOpenDocs
(requires Microsoft Word for desktop)

Autohotkey (AHK) script that will search for the selected text (inside Word) across all currently open documents.

* It is recommended to assign it as a hotkey to a persistent script.
* Select text within Word and run this hotkey to find a match across all open documents.
* When clicking on the document name, the script activates that document and automatically moves to the found string.
