# FindAcrossAllOpenDocs
(requires Microsoft Word for desktop)

Autohotkey (AHK) script that will search for the selected text (inside Word) across all currently open documents.

* Search within multiple Word documents at the same time
* It is recommended to assign it as a hotkey to a persistent script; select text within Word and run this hotkey to find a match across all open documents
* When clicking on the document name, the script activates that document and automatically moves to the found string
* The selected text is also stored in the clipboard
